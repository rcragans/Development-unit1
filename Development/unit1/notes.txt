man: The man command - the manual command - is used to show the manual of the inputted command. 
Just like a film on the nature of film, the man command is the meta command of the Linux CLI. 
Inputting the man command will show you all information about the command you are using. An example:

man cd


rmdir: The rmdir - remove directory - command allows the user to remove an existing command using the Linux CLI. 
An example of the rmdir command:

rmdir testdirectory


locate : The locate - a.k.a. find - command is meant to find a file within the Linux OS. If you don't know the name of a certain file or you aren't sure where the file is saved and stored, the locate command comes in handy. A locate command example:

locate -i *red*house**city*
